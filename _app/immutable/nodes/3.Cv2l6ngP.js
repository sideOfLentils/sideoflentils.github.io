        and how it connects to all other fields in ways I couldn&#39;t have imagined before coming to the university. 
        Now that I am working on completing my Masters, I have a better sense of what is possible and what I can contribute, whether 
        it be working in data science using SQL queries, 
        python to construct a neural network using PyTorch, C++ to build a game with Unreal Engine 5, Haskell to write an interpreter for other programming languages, 
        or C to communicate with other systems over a network using OpenMP and MPI, the possibilities are endless.</p> <p>Right now, I&#39;m learning about what it takes to become an AI engineer 
        while still expanding my knowledge of front-end web development with the creation of this portfolio website.</p> <p>In the future, I plan to explore how mobile applications are created to better understand the field of IoT within computer science.</p>`,i,n;return{c(){e=h("section"),e.innerHTML=l,i=w(),n=h("p")},l(t){e=c(t,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(e)!=="svelte-1vfup7a"&&(e.innerHTML=l),i=g(t),n=c(t,"P",{}),b(n).forEach(o)},m(t,a){r(t,e,a),r(t,i,a),r(t,n,a)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(t){t&&(o(e),o(i),o(n))}}}class k extends u{constructor(e){super(),d(this,e,null,I,m,{})}}export{k as component};
